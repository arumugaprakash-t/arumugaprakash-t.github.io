<div class="intro-text" markdown="1">

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at SIMPL with 4+ years building scalable payment systems and distributed microservices. I work with Golang, Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka to architect high-performance backend systems.

I'm passionate about distributed systems, database internals, and backend architecture. Currently focused on payment gateway orchestration, event-driven architectures, and observability at scale.
